style.css: This is the stylesheet block which gives us the proper look of the webpage.
Navigation bar styling: It basically consists of logo styling and content styling. First of all we have considered the navigation bar as a flexbox and assigned the flex-direction to “column”. Then we considered the content of the navigation bar as a flexbox and then we have positioned it properly.
Background image styling: We used before pseudo selectors to set the respective background images.
